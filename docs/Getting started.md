# Getting started

## General recommendations

There are going to be modules you end up using more than others, and I strongly suggest you make aliases for these. Umbra intentionally doesn't ship specific aliases, as based on experience with aliases and keybinds, it's a fucking nightmare to find aliases (or keybinds) that universally work in dynamic setups like a shell. Therefore, this part is left as an optional, but strongly recommended step. 

Personally, I (or at least plan to, at the time of writing) use the `zellij` module extensively, so I have:
```bash
alias z="umbra zellij"
```
